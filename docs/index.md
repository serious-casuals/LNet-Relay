# LNET-Discord Bridge Documentation

Welcome to the comprehensive documentation for the LNET-Discord Bridge application - an AI-assisted translation and modernization project demonstrating best practices in .NET 9 development.

## üéØ Project Overview

This application bridges LNET (LichNet) game servers with Discord, enabling real-time communication between in-game players and Discord users. Built as an educational exploration of AI-assisted software development, this project demonstrates modern .NET patterns, high-performance networking, and production-ready architecture.

## üìö Documentation Sections

### Core Libraries

</div>

## üöÄ Quick Start

### Prerequisites

- .NET 9.0 SDK or later
- Docker (for containerized deployment)
- LNET server access (GemStone IV or DragonRealms account)
- Discord Bot Token and server permissions

### Installation

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone <repository-url>
cd lnet-discord-bridge

# Restore dependencies
dotnet restore

# Build the solution
dotnet build
```

### Basic Usage

```csharp
using LNet;

// Configure LNET client
var options = new Options
{
    Host = "lnet.lichproject.org",
    User = "YourUsername",
    Game = "GSIV",
    EnableKeepalive = true
};

// Connect and process messages
using var client = await Client.CreateAsync(options);
await foreach (var message in client.GetMessageStreamAsync())
{
    Console.WriteLine($"Received: {message}");
}
```

## üéì Educational Focus

This project serves as a comprehensive learning experience exploring:

- **AI-Assisted Development**: Best practices for leveraging LLMs in software engineering
- **Cross-Language Translation**: Converting GoLang applications to modern C#
- **Performance Engineering**: Span-based parsing and zero-allocation techniques
- **Production Architecture**: Resilient, scalable system design patterns

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Important Notice
