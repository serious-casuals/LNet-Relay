# LNET-Discord Bridge Application

## 🎯 Project Overview

This repository contains a complete application ecosystem that bridges LNET (LichNet) game servers with Discord, enabling real-time communication between in-game players and Discord users. The application demonstrates modern .NET 9 development practices, high-performance network programming, and containerized microservice architecture.

## 🧪 Educational Purpose & AI-Assisted Development

**This project serves as a learning experience and research initiative focused on:**

- **AI-Assisted Software Development**: Exploring best practices for leveraging Large Language Models (LLMs) in software engineering workflows
- **Cross-Language Translation**: Demonstrating the feasibility of translating existing applications from one programming language (Go) to another (C#) using AI assistance
- **Modern .NET Patterns**: Implementing current best practices in .NET 9, including performance optimizations, dependency injection, and containerization
- **Production-Ready Architecture**: Building resilient, scalable systems using industry-standard patterns and practices

### 🔄 Translation Project

This C# implementation is a translation and modernization of an existing GoLang application. The project explores:

- Language paradigm differences and adaptation strategies
- Performance characteristic preservation across languages
- Modern framework adoption during translation
- Architecture pattern evolution

## 📦 Components

### 🔌 LNet Library
High-performance .NET 9 client library for LNET protocol communication:

- **Span-based XML parsing** for zero-allocation performance
- **Production-grade resilience** with timeout handling, error recovery, and memory pressure management
- **SSL/TLS support** with certificate validation
- **Automatic keepalive** management
- **Channel-based message processing** using .NET 9 optimizations
- **Comprehensive logging** with ZLogger integration

**Key Features:**
- Buffer boundary protection for network data fragmentation
- Malformed XML recovery with circuit breaker patterns
- Adaptive memory management with multiple buffer pools
- Event-driven architecture with async/await patterns

### 🤖 Discord Library
Modern Discord bot client with advanced features:

- **Slash command support** with parameter validation
- **Embed-rich messaging** with dynamic content
- **Role-based permissions** and access control
- **Rate limiting** and API optimization
- **WebSocket connection management** with reconnection logic

### 🌉 Bridge Service
Central orchestration service that connects the two systems:

- **Message translation** between LNET and Discord protocols
- **User mapping** and authentication
- **Channel routing** and filtering
- **Command processing** and response handling
- **Health monitoring** and metrics collection

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- **.NET 9.0 SDK** or later
- **Docker** (for containerized deployment)
- **LNET server access** (GemStone IV or DragonRealms account)
- **Discord Bot Token** and server permissions

## 📊 Performance Characteristics

### LNet Library Performance
- **Zero-allocation parsing** using ReadOnlySpan<byte>
- **~1000 messages/second** processing capability

- **Production-tested resilience** with comprehensive error recovery

### Discord Library Performance
- **Rate limit compliance** with intelligent queuing
- **Batch message processing** for efficiency
- **Connection pooling** and persistent WebSocket connections
- **Graceful degradation** under API limits



### Health Monitoring

The application exposes health check endpoints:
- `/health` - Overall application health
- `/health/lnet` - LNET connection status
- `/health/discord` - Discord connection status

### Logging and Metrics
